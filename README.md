Simulate exploits, disassemble protocols, and find the assumptions others miss.

My focus:
- Rebuilding famous hacks step-by-step (Foundry-powered)
- Exploit-level reasoning with Yul & Huff
- Threat modeling: every line is guilty until proven safe
- Formal verification experiments (WIP)

Method:
1. Recreate. Exploit. Break.
2. Push limits of EVM tools.
3. Patch only if the design deserves it.

Core Arsenal: Foundry, Slither, Huff, Yul, Echidna, Mythril
