I specialize in tearing down Solidity contracts, simulating real exploits, and transforming vulnerabilities into hardened defenses.
**Primarily an auditor,** I'm also **open** to **smart contract development** roles that demand **high security standards.**

## Focus
- **Attack Simulations**: Rebuilding actual DeFi/NFT exploits with Foundry  
- **Deep EVM**: Calldata edge cases, gas griefing, storage collisions  
- **Huff & Yul**: Low-level wizardry for advanced optimizations and exploit research  
- **Threat Modeling**: Every line of code is suspect until proven safe  
- **Formal Verification** (WIP): Pushing protocols to mathematical certainty  
- **Secure Development**: Building production contracts with an auditor’s mindset

## Methodology
1. **Recreate** known hacks → replicate them step-by-step  
2. **Push** beyond standard frameworks → discover new vulnerabilities  
3. **Patch or Document** all flaws → fix them or make them known cautions
